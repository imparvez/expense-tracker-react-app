# React Context API
- Context provides a way to pass data through component tree without having to pass props
down manually at every level.
- In a simple term, it provides a way to share values between components.
- This new API solves props drilling. It is a process of getting data from component A to component Z by passing it through multiple layers of intermediary React components.
- As a React developer, we have to make sure that every components is getting the right data.
- Context API allows you to have a central store where your data will live.
- This store can now be inserted into any component directly cutting all the middleman.
